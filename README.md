# Fair-Share-Property-Tax-Assessment-project-

As Durham County undergoes the property tax reassessment process this year, community groups are gearing up to support homeowners who may be unfairly impacted. Research shows that owners of lower-value homes are the most likely group to experience overassessment, compounding an already regressive system in which lowincome homeowners pay a large percentage of their income in property taxes. As part of the effort to support lower-income homeowners in Durham, our team seeks to identify neighborhoods that may have high levels of property tax regressivity, through analysis of tax and sales records since the last reassessment. Our goal, in partnership with DataWorks NC, is to create an online, interactive tool that will allow users to find geographic areas at risk of overassessment and empower these users to take action.
