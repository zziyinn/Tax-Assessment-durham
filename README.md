# Property Tax Regressivity in Durham County

This project analyzes **property tax and home sales data** in Durham County, NC, with the goal of identifying neighborhoods most at risk of tax overassessment. The work supports efforts by local organizations to bring equity and transparency to the property tax system.

## Project Introduction

As Durham County undergoes its property tax reassessment this year, community groups are working to protect homeownersâ€”especially those with lower-value homesâ€”who are most vulnerable to being overassessed. These overassessments disproportionately affect low-income residents, contributing to a regressive property tax system.

In collaboration with **DataWorks NC**, our team aims to highlight neighborhoods with potential tax unfairness by analyzing tax assessment and sales data since the last reassessment. The result will be an **interactive web tool** to help residents, advocates, and policymakers identify areas of concern and advocate for change.
